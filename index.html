        <p class="content-text">Merry Christmas, Puppy! This isn't much, but I wanted to make a little something for you.. It's nothing compared to the project you made for me, but I cooked this up at the last second before Christmas! I just want to let you know how grateful I am to have you in my life. Not a day goes by where I don't think back on all the memories we made. The feelings I developed for you over time, the comfort I feel being in call with you all the time and sharing games like Payday and Monster Hunter. I don't think I've ever felt this loved before. Honestly, I don't feel worthy of love.. I feel like someone like me would always perish alone in the end, but you make me feeel otherwise! I get scared a lot.. I'm a person plagued with anxiety about being alone, so thank you for accepting and comforting me lots. I hope you become even happier with me and we can build something together! You really are the best! Let momma take care of you~! I love you so much!!!</p>
        <p class="content-text-two">Yours Truly, Syl</p>
